Summary

This file is a Radiometric Terrain Corrected granule of GRD SAR data from the Sentinel-1 mission, processed using S1TBX software. Cell values indicate VH gamma-0 amplitude, and pixel spacing is 30 m.

Description

This Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) product is derived from a Ground Range Detected (GRD) granule of Synthetic Aperture Radar data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission (European Space Agency), generated using ASF HyP3 RTC-S1TBX software version 1.0 running Sentinel-1 Toolbox (S1TBX) release 6.0. It is projected to WGS 84 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, and is corrected for terrain using a digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM used for this product is NED13 (about 10 m resolution).

Processing Date/Time: 20190408 18050500 UTC

In the filename, VV (HH) indicates the primary polarization, while VH (HV) indicates cross-polarization. To learn more about polarimetry, refer to https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/product-overview/polarimetry

The name of the granule used to generate this TIFF file is: S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDV_20190210T015109_20190210T015134_025861_02E0D3_CEE5. For a detailed description of the Sentinel-1 file naming convention, refer to https://www.asf.alaska.edu/sentinel/data/#naming

The side-looking geometry of SAR imagery leads to geometric and radiometric distortions, causing foreshortening, layover, shadowing, and radiometric variations due to terrain slope. Radiometric terrain correction converts unprocessed SAR data into geocoded tiff images with values directly relating to physical properties, alleviating the inherent SAR distortions. The process improves backscatter estimates and provides geolocation information, so images can be used as input for applications such as the monitoring of deforestation, land-cover classification, and delineation of wet snow-covered areas.

Cell values indicate VH gamma nought amplitude, and pixel spacing is 30 m. If the output is in power rather than amplitude, the images may appear mostly black when first displayed. Consider setting the layer symbology to Stretched - Standard Deviations (choose a number (n) that works best for your particular dataset; the ArcGIS default of n: 2.5 will improve the display, but other values may give a better visualization).

This product was processed using 3 look(s). Multi-looking is the process of coherently averaging together pixels of an image. The overall effect of multi-looking is to reduce the noise level, thus reducing speckle, at the cost of decreased resolution. Multi-looking is not applied for 10-m products.

This image has been speckle filtered. The default is to not apply a speckle filter, but the user can choose to apply a filter when ordering the RTC imagery. When the filtering option is selected, the S1TBX default Speckle Filter is applied during RTC processing to remove speckle while preserving edges. When applied, it is a Lee Sigma filter set to one look with a window size of 7x7, a sigma of 0.9 and a target window size of 3x3.

You may wish to explore the filtering options available in ArcGIS rather than ordering imagery with a filter already applied. There are many options for different speckle filter functions to be applied on the fly using the Image Analysis window. To learn more about speckle filtering options, refer to http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/speckle-function.htm and to learn how apply a function (such as a speckle filter) to a raster, refer to http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/editing-functions-on-a-raster-dataset.htm

For areas where there is not a publicly-available digital elevation model (i.e. sea ice), geocoded products without terrain correction are also available from http://hyp3.asf.alaska.edu/

The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, and the Sentinel-1B satellite was launched April 25, 2016. The satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle. More information about the mission is available at https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/sentinel-1
